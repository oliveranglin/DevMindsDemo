                                All of us are affected by emotional difficulties at some point, particularly when dealing with the challenges life throws at us. We may
                                feel sad or anxious and this can have an effect on our day to day lives - our thoughts and behaviours, our relationships and our
                                performance at work. For many people it can be very hard to see what has triggered their feelings of distress and unhappiness.
                                It could be that there is a general feeling of dissatisfaction with life which is hard to pin down. Some people's problems may 
                                be related to sudden stresses like bereavement or another traumatic life event. In other situations problems may be linked to 
                                longer standing difficulties, such as painful childhood experiences.

                    Compassion focused therapy is a process of developing compassion and kindness for the self and others. This is effective for overcoming

                    <br>
                    Mindfulness is an integrative mind-body approach in which a mental state is achieved by focusing awareness on the present moment. By
                     paying more attention to your thoughts and feelings as they happen, you can have a significant positive impact on your mental wellbeing.
                      Practicing mindfulness has been proven to reduce levels of stress, anxiety and depression.

                    <br>
                    Cognitive behavioural therapy can be the most effective form of treatment for a wide range of problems. CBT involves understanding how your
                     thoughts, feelings and behaviour interact to play a role in your problems. Effective treatment is about altering beliefs and changing behaviour 
                     with the aim of improving your feelings. While CBT can be the most effective treatment, it does not work for every problem. We can also use other
                      psychological therapies in order to best help an individual case.

                    <br>
                    EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing) is a comprehensive psychotherapy that helps you process and recover from past experiences that are affecting your mental health and wellbeing.

It involves using side to side eye movements combined with talk therapy in a specific and structured format. 

EMDR helps you process the negative images, emotions, beliefs and body sensations associated with traumatic memories that seem to be stuck. These can contribute to a range of mental health problems.

EMDR helps you to see things from a different perspective and relieves the symptoms that you were suffering.

                    ACT is a form of therapy that teaches mindfulness skills. There is also a large emphasis on connecting with values, to that which matters the most to us. This helps to align our actions and bring us towards where we really want to be.

Mindfulness skills enable us to learn to be in the moment, connect more to who matters and make the most of each and every day. Mindfulness skills help us to unhook from unhelpful thoughts and to struggle less with uncomfortable emotions. One of the key aims of ACT is to help increase our levels of psychological flexibility.

When we have greater psychological flexibility, it does not mean that we will never feel down or stressed again. What it does mean is that when unwanted or difficult situations arise in our life, we are able to respond to them by adapting and applying the skills that we have learned.
